Chain Project â€“ VectorDB + RAG + LLMs
This project is a complete end-to-end implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain, supporting OpenAI, Ollama, and Hugging Face models. It covers every core component â€” from document ingestion, vector indexing, and embedding generation to conversational chatbot agents.

Built with modular notebooks and scripts, this project is ideal for learning, experimentation, and even production deployment of LLM-based Q&A systems.

 What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that improves LLM responses by combining pre-trained models with external knowledge sources. Instead of relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a vector store and uses them as context to generate accurate, grounded answers.

This makes the system more factual, scalable, and adaptable to domain-specific content (e.g., custom PDF files or speech transcripts).

How It Works (RAG Flow in the project)
1.Ingest Documents: PDF, speech transcripts, HTML, etc.

2.Split into Chunks: Using recursive or custom text splitters.

3.Generate Embeddings: With OpenAI, Hugging Face, or Ollama.

4.Store in Vector DB: Use Chroma or FAISS to index embeddings.

5.Query via LLM: Retrieve relevant docs and generate grounded answers.

6.Conversational Memory: Use LangChain memory modules for continuity.
